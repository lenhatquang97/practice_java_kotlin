# Practice Whiteboard Coding with Java and Kotlin

### Books to practice   
- Learn: Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and Algorithms 4th Edition by Sedgewick and Wayne.

- Practice: Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

### Big-O Notation
- Revise: Cracking the Coding Interview - Big O
- Big O in academics:
    - O (Big O): upper bound of the time complexity of the algorithm. O(n) but can be O(n^2) or O(n!)
    - Ω (Big omega): lower bound of the time complexity of the algorithm. Ω(n) but can be Ω(logn) or Ω(1)
    - θ (Big theta): average time complexity of the algorithm. θ(n) = O(n) + Ω(n)
- Best, Worst and Expected Case
- Note for reading source code: have enough deep analysis.
### Arrays and Strings
- Theories:
    - Hash Tables (Separate Chaining and Open Addressing)
    - ArrayList (dynamic array)
    - StringBuilder
- Exercises:
    - [x] Is Unique: Answer: use HashSet or bit vector if cannot use data structures
    - [x] Check Permutation: Check two hashmaps
    - [x] URLify: Inplace edit on string (trivial)
### Linked Lists 
- Theories:
    - Singly Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List
    - Circular Linked List
- Techinques:
    - **The "Runner" Technique**
    - **Recursion**
- Exercises:
    - [x] Remove Duplicates in unsorted linked list (doing)
    - [x] Return Kth to Last: Return the value of the node at the kth to last position in a singly linked list
    - [x] Delete Middle Node: Delete the middle node of a singly linked list, if there are even number of nodes, delete the node after the middle node (doing)
